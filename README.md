# Project1

by David Burke, 
This is a collection of my work as part of the Programming for Data Analysis Project 1.

To run this notebook with all features, you will need;
- The Data folder conmtained in the repository and the included info text file. The path from the jupyter notebook to this info file should be "Data\KeyHourly.txt"
- A live internet connection, the data used is pulled directly from a CSV hosted online

My work is contained in the Project1.jpynb Notebook
